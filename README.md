# CP3402 Assignment 2 - Group 7 : A Custom Wordpress Theme


# Ian Kirkwood

This project is the second assignment(A2) of course CP3402- Content Management Systems - SP21 that requires a development of custom wordPress theme from scratch and build a website using that theme. So, our main motive was to built a custom wordPress theme and use it in building a website for our client "Dr. Ian Kirkwood".

## Getting Started

To help you get a copy of this project and setting up and running on your local development machine follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Things required to be installed before starting.

### Installing

Server
A local server is required to run the website. You can use any server that can host a website on your local machine. Some of the ideal choices would be 
XAMPP : https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
MAMP : https://www.mamp.info/en/

## Code style

## Deployment

To deploy the files on a live system please extract the database files and other files from local machine and import into the live server. It would be appropriate to use the wordPress plugins such as "All-in-One WP Migration" to import and export to avoid any complications and issues during deployment.
